# supply-chain-claw

A long-running Next.js project to build a global, explorable map of supply chains.

## Vision

Track how goods move across:

- raw materials
- components (CPU/GPU and beyond)
- manufacturing
- logistics
- retail

## Current phase

- Explorer-first product UX (search, filters, country/material drilldown)
- Source-cited raw-material numeric tables
- Interactive world map baseline

## Next milestones

1. Keep Home as the explorer command center (search, filters, map, importer/exporter summaries).
2. Add material detail pages (`/materials/[slug]`) with exact values, units, years, trends, and citations.
3. Add country detail pages (`/countries/[slug]`) with role breakdowns, trade partners, and dependency indicators.
4. Add compare view (`/compare`) for country-vs-country and material-vs-material analysis.
5. Add methodology page (`/methodology`) with sources, update cadence, and confidence rules.
6. Continue expanding raw-material and broader datasets with source-cited numeric records.
